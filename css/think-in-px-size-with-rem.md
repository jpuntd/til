# Think in pixels, size with rem unit

The default font size from the useragent stylesheet is 16px. Set the size for the root element to 62.5%:

    html { font-size:62.5% }

This takes 16px down to 10px. We can think in pixels but set sizes in terms of rems:

- 1rem is 10px,
- 0.8rem is 8px,
- 1.6rem is 16px, etc.
