# Open the Chrome DevTools Command Panel

VS Code has a nice command panel to lookup (and perform) commands.
Today I learned Chrome DevTools have the same.

Inside Chrome DevTools, press <kbd>Control</kbd>+<kbd>Shift</kbd>+<kbd>P</kbd>.

The Command Panel will open and show `>`.
Start typing a command and suggestions will show.

Remove the `>` sign to access additional commands, like `!` for launching a DevTools code snippet.
