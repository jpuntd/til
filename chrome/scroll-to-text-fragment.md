# Scroll To Text Fragment

Today I learned that you can add a `#:~:text=something` location hash to an URL. Chrome will then scroll to and highlight the text `something` on the page.
Use `#:~:text=<first word>,<last word>` to highlight a long paragraph.

[Use this bookmarklet](https://paul.kinlan.me/scroll-to-text-bookmarklet/#:~:text=you%20can%20drag%20this) to easily add the location hash to an url.
